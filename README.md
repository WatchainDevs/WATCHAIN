# Watch Certificate on Blockchain

## Overview

This project offers a solution for generating and verifying certificates of authenticity for luxury watches using blockchain technology. The certificates are uniquely tied to both the watch and its owner, stored immutably on the blockchain. Only the validators authorized by the watch producer are allowed to enforce changes in property ownership, ensuring security and trust.

## Features

- **Blockchain-Based Certificates**: Each watch owner receives a certificate that is securely stored on the blockchain, preventing fraud and unauthorized changes.
- **Authorized Validators**: Only validators approved by the watch producer can force a change in ownership or modify certificate data, providing additional layers of security.
- **Proof of Ownership**: The certificate serves as proof of ownership and can be transferred securely between parties, but only through validator approval.
- **Verification**: Anyone can verify the authenticity of a watch by querying the blockchain for its certificate.
- **Immutable Records**: Once a certificate is issued, it is permanently recorded on the blockchain and cannot be altered by unauthorized parties.
